# Chaotic-Map
In mathematics, a chaotic map is a map (= evolution function) that exhibits some sort of chaotic behavior. 
Maps may be parameterized by a discrete-time or a continuous-time parameter. Discrete maps usually take the form of iterated functions. Chaotic maps often occur in the study of dynamical systems.
